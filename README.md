# Odds-Evens
Odds & Evens is a game developed mainly in JS.

For this game, I'm using:
HTML;
CSS;
Bootstrap;
Javascript.

The goal is to design a game that can be played on a large or small screen.
The user will compete against a computer that will generate random numbers.
The game keeps track of the score and displays the winner to the user.
